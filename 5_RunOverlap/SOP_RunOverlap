When composite file are finalize and use layer have been moved to library in the correct projection
the overlap runs can be started; output raw overlap for each use site by region, species group

Key variable - Use layers and Species files are in the same projections; cell size for use layer is identified
Updates will need to occur if: use  layer or species range files change, projection is off

Key Tracking : Root folder for output file locations need to remain consistant for all runs.  File structure
is automated.

# TODO set up so output folder name is read in from table - making consistent folder name is tricky due to variation in
# Use layer names

** Prior to running the overlap Symbology layers should be updated - this will be variable used in an number of place
** Be sure to update the snap raster dictionary as well
***KEY ASSUMPUTION All use layer must start with the projection name follow by the regions abbreviation or CDL and then
the use with the _euc if is distance raster

Step 1 - General overlap for species range and CH composites; can be used for varied unique IDs; ie ZoneID, InterID etc
    NOTE - Temp files will sometime save in the in_species location - these are grids that start with t_ - this can
    cause the scrop to stop saving output - these files should be deleted )
    - TODO figure out why these temp files are saved
    - Runs by region
    - Run multiple regions at the same time - regions takes less time than CONUS ~ 1.5 hours per use for CONUS
        - To speed up CONUS runs use the sub-set use variable and run the uses in groups rather than the whole gdb
    - When running input files with habitat, elevation, states and HUC birds, fish, mammals, flowering plants amphibians
    take a long time fish is the longest.  batch by regions and groups of species to minmize run time. sometimes these
    files require more memory than the computer has.  These runs can be done in the lab or try running only one
    instance at a time
    TODO look at spliting input files into multiple grids with only 1,000,000 unique zone
    - Output is msq distance is row wise zone for species is column wise

Step 2- Overlap for aquatic species based on catchment: - ON HOLD
    - Runs by region
    -Output is pixel count catchment ID is row wise and distance is column wise - transformed so there wouldn't be
    millions of columns  easier to have millions of row
    #TODO - update needs to be finalized for Step 2 needs;; can we simplify?

Step 2b- Overlap for aquatic species based HUC12: - ON HOLD
    - ON HOLD
    - Runs by region
    - Original overlap for NHD when just doing HUC - likely will be archived
        - NOTE HAS NOT BEEN updated if we start to use this one again inputs should be streamlined to match others
        in this tool

Step 3 - Run overlap against political boundaries used for usage :
    - Only need for usage see ApplyUsage SOP

Step 4 - Place holder for running a vector use:
    # TODO finished this script then update table automation to account for a vector use
