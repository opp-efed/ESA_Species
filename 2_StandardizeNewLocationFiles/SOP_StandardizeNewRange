Purpose: When new range or critical habitat files are received from the Services these scripts will make a copy of the
original file, standardize the file, standardize the information in the attribute tab;e using the current master species
list, and then standardizes the projection to a NAD83 geographic projection. Final species file will be a single multi-
part polygon.

Time Consideration â€“ All species must be accounted for and pass all Quality Control checks before moving forward.
Generally, this step takes a couple of days to a week to complete due to the coordination or follow-up on any
tricky species.  No one script takes an extreme amount of time, but some of the QC checks can take several hours
based on the extent of the species file.

Goal: One spatial file per species with standardize file name with update date, attributes and projection.  Species
files are represented as one multi-part polygon.

Description: When new location files are received from the Services these scripts will make a copy of the original file,
standardize the file name including a date stamp, standardize the information in the attribute table using the current
master species list, and then standardizes the projection to a NAD83 geographic projection. Final species files are
single multi-part polygons.

# TODO combine Step 1, 2, 3 into on script - dynamically set up file name dictionary to master species list (step 3)
Step1_ListFilesNames - Makes a list of the new files and saves it to a csv - will recursively search in the folder
for all shapefiles

Step2_CopyToGeodatabase - Make a copy of the original files from the input directory to a gdb; Step 2a check to make
sure all files copy to gdb  and the files copied completely - incomplete files will not have any rows of any rows of data

Step3_StndFilesNames- Copies the files from the gdb and re-names to the standard file name schema used a dictionary
lookup NmChangeDICT.  This dictionary is create manually using the master species list.  The information from the master
species list is also used in Step 6
  - File name structure filetype_entityid_featuretype_date
    - file type can be range (R) or critical habitat (CH
    - entityid is from the master species list - NOTE be sure the entity id is species to species and population
    - feature type - polygon (poly), line(line) , point (point), Cart - polygon file collected as part of the gas
    cartridge effor for Bulletins, GAP-polygon file generated from the GAP pilot the files were generated from the GAP
    land cover layer and habitat assigned by the Services - Fall 2016
    - date - date  received
    - After files are moved to spatial library, point and line are buffered and species with multiple files are merger
        - these are identified in the featuretype part of the name
        - lineBuffer or pointBuffer means the file was buffered to a polygon
        - merged files will have _merged in the file name and the dates of the two orginal files and the date of the
        final file in the file name
# TODO Combine Step 3,4,5,6 into a single script

Step4_popfilename - Adds the new files to the attribute table

Step5_Dissolve - Dissolves file into a single multi-part polygon - this structure is needed for the composite files;
when there composites are create a species need to represented by a single row of data. NOTE - original aquatic files
received from Services had geometry and topology errors, therefore created the 5b script to try to rectify these errors
and move the files to a separate location if errors could not be rectified.  This script can probably be archived

# TODO update the manually made join table to a join in pandas back to the master species list
Step6_PopulateDissolved - Loads standard species information based on the master species into the attribute table
NOTE - this join table is made manually by filtering the master list to just the species with a new file and limiting
the columns to the information desired for the attribute table.  This can be updated to a dynamic process. Steb 6b
confirms that all of the files were copied, completed and contains the desired attribute information - append STD to
file name

Step7_ProjectSTD_STDGeo - projects files into the standard NAD 83 geographic projection before the files are moved to
the species spatial libraries
