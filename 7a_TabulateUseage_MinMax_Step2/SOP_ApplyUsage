# Steps 1 4 are completed ont he usage overlap output results
# Step 2 is then used as inpute for Step 2a ofr 7b
# Step 2 is use as inputs for Step 2b of 7B
# TODO Will need to make a table that is used for Step 1 and Step of 7b that excludes elevation


Scripts in 5_RunOverlap - use TabulalteArea scripts not Zonal - Zonal scripts archived for comparision
    - updatesd summer 2018 changed overlap run to Tabulate area from Zonal histogram due to processing time of
    zonal histogram with the combined input files - spot checked outputs using both tools and results

        Step3_RunOverlap_usage_boundaries_TabulateArea: Run overlap on the political boundaries using Step3_RunOverlap_usage_boundaries. This information is needed to
            do the state adjustments of use within the species range and use outside the species range.
                - Run time ~ 2 hours/ use split into groups to speed up
                -TODO find lost scratch path - temp files saving in current directory
                - Used in 7a - Step 2 - variable in_locations_states # totals for states

        Step1_Species_Use_TabulateArea: Run Overlap to species input files with the additional information added during the combine
        - Run time ~ NL48 takes a couple of hours to run combined input files, L48 CH tales be 1.5 -10 mins for a use
        depending on species (ch_fishes is the longest; range takes between 8 hours and 1 hour per use (r_birds longest)
        split up uses and or species input to speed up


 Step B: Create master input files for species, extracting the species by entity ID, HUCS, Elevation, Habitat, FIPS and
 STATEs
    From 7a_ TabulateUsage_MinMax
        1a_CreateUsageOverlapTables_PolBoundaries_TabArea- add area and column and sums by fips and state then exports
        tables to Counties and state folder with all uses rather than use layer folder

        1b_tranforms table from zone to species, extract HUC, States and does the filters for habitat and elevations
        THere will be one parent table each types )(elevation, no adjest habitat etc).
        NL48 takes ~ 45 minutes
        L48 tales ~ 10 hour when do all species and uses at once, can split out species using spcies spkit


        run step 2 - adjust the species by state based on PCT - pulls in parent species table and political usage
        overlap
            #TODO do we need to adjust for redunacy first; I can pull the factors from the unadjust table then apply them
        Step 3: generated parent drift tables for each filter category
        Step 4: generates the 'all uses' table for each filter category
        Step 5 Merged the AQU tables into one with the use layers across the top and species in the cols include % ares
        of huc - see schema in OneNote

         Step B  generates the input pct tables needed to adjusted the outputs from SUUM
         Step C  generated the aggregated PCT from the SUUM oct in Step b

      Run 7b: B and step 2a and 2b
      Team decisions: Spring/Summer 2018
      # Step 1 call <1% overlap from AA
      # Step 2 call <1% overlap from adjusted PCT (NLAA call) based on sum after factor is applied - replacing the NLAA overlap call
      we made for diazinon - NOTE REMOVED - COLLEEN STATED NO LONGER PART OF THE USAGE PROCESS GIS MEETING FEB 2019

        # run for each parent table generate in step 2 and 3 ie, elevation, elevation usage min, max, averaage, lower,
        upper, uniform etc
        # TODO set up to use the file name to put to the correct out file directory
