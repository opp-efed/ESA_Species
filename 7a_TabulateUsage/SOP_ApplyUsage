# Steps 1 4 are completed ont he usage overlap output results
# Step 2 is then used as inpute for Step 2a ofr 7b
# Step 2 is use as inputs for Step 2b of 7B
# TODO Will need to make a table that is used for Step 1 and Step of 7b that excludes elevation


Scripts in 5_RunOverlap - use TabulalteArea scripts not Zonal - Zonal scripts archived for comparision
    - updatesd summer 2018 changed overlap run to Tabulate area from Zonal histogram due to processing time of
    zonal histogram with the combined input files - spot checked outputs using both tools and results

        Step3_RunOverlap_usage_boundaries_TabulateArea: Run overlap on the political boundaries using Step3_RunOverlap_usage_boundaries. This information is needed to
            do the state adjustments of use within the species range and use outside the species range.
                - Run time ~ 2 hours/ use split into groups to speed up
                -TODO find lost scratch path - temp files saving in current directory
                - Used in 7a - Step 2 - variable in_locations_states # totals for states

        Step1_Species_Use_TabulateArea: Run Overlap to species input files with the additional information added during the combine
        - Run time ~ NL48 takes a couple of hours to run combined input files, L48 CH tales be 1.5 -10 mins for a use
        depending on species (ch_fishes is the longest; range takes between 8 hours and 1 hour per use (r_birds longest)
        split up uses and or species input to speed up


 Step B: Create master input files for species, extracting the species by entity ID, HUCS, Elevation, Habitat, FIPS and
 STATEs
    From 7a_ TabulateUsage_MinMax
        1a_CreateUsageOverlapTables_PolBoundaries_TabArea- add area and column and sums by fips and state then exports
        tables to Counties and state folder with all uses rather than use layer folder

        1b_tranforms table from zone to species, extract HUC, States and does the filters for habitat and elevations
        THere will be one parent table each types )(elevation, no adjest habitat etc).
        NL48 takes ~ 45 minutes
        L48 tales ~ 10 hour when do all species and uses at once, can split out species using spcies spkit


        run step 2 - adjust the species by state based on PCT - pulls in parent species table and political usage
        overlap

        Step 3: generated parent drift tables for each filter category
        Step 4: generates the 'all uses' table for each filter category
        Step 5 Merged the AQU tables into one with the use layers across the top and species in the cols include % ares
        of huc - see schema in OneNote

         Step B  generates the input pct tables needed to adjusted the outputs from SUUM
         Step C  generated the aggregated PCT from the SUUM oct in Step b

      Run 7b: B and step 2a and 2b
      Team decisions: Spring/Summer 2018
      # Step 1 call <1% overlap from AA
      # Step 2 call <1% overlap from adjusted PCT (NLAA call) based on sum after factor is applied - replacing the NLAA overlap call
      we made for diazinon - NOTE REMOVED - COLLEEN STATED NO LONGER PART OF THE USAGE PROCESS GIS MEETING FEB 2019

        # run for each parent table generate in step 2 and 3 ie, elevation, elevation usage min, max, averaage, lower,
        upper, uniform etc
        # TODO set up to use the file name to put to the correct out file directory


Just Usage Tables notes
    Run Overlap
        -Run overlap using tabulate area - save to a usage folder script 5_Step1
        -Run Pol Boundaries overlap using tabulate area - save to Pol Boundaries folder in usage folder script 5_Step3
    Tabulate Species
        - Tabulate species, full range and spe pol boundary - 7a_Step1b - Save to general folder and applied
        to all chems
        -Apply PCT - saves to chemical folder - there will be a folder for each PCT and on for no adjustment -
         still by species - only need to run 1 of the step 2 scripts
            -2 - just applies PCT
            2b - applies PCT, excluding counties from the PCT application if there are no registered crops in the
            county; set for both species and state
                using the pre_abs table
            2c - LOOK AT DIFFERENT -making too many assumptions about where usage is occurring
        - Summarize to drift intervals = generate the drift folder
            - In spray drift root folder there will be folder for each run type - ie census, no adjustment, and no
            adjustment
                - census - with summarized PCT adjustment for upper, lower, and uniform summed species
                - no adjustment - not PCT applied, not census mask- summed to species
                - Parent folder
                    - Folder for each PCT
                        - with in for each run type - files by use still broken out by state with PCT information
                    - No adjustment Folder
                        - file for each use broken out by state
        - Summarize into ground ind aerial 7a_Step4
        - Generate GIS, CONUS and NL48 tables
            - Use the drift and SummarizeBE table and scipts - in scrip 7b_Step2a, Stepb2b
            - Point to the run type for the table you are you in the spray drift folder as the out location



Aquatic Tables notes
- Get range area by HU for species in using the Lookup tables that have the HUC information- 7a_Stepa
- Merge the range area by HUC with overlap information by HUC
    - Point to the tabulate Agg Layer folder use for all chemicals -- NO PCT; need all use layers in L48 and NL48 s
    script to finish
    -chemical independent - includes all layer in agg folder
    - comment out NL48 at end if jut need CONUS
