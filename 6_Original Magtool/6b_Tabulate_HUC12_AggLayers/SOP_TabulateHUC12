After overlap runs are complete raw results are will be transformed from pixel counts by distance to percent overlap by
distance interval for runs specific to the NHD

Key variable - Acres tables need to be locked to get to percentage; Need buy in chemical team on look-up table

Key Tracking : Root folder for output file locations need to remain consistent for all runs.  File structure
is automated.   Look-up table should have buy in from chemical team


Step 1-  Transforms table from  and convert numbers from pixels to percentage
Step 2 - Breaks tables into the desired distance interval - default 30m
Step 3- Generates the summary tables for the BE - ie direct use overlap, overlap for ground and aerial
