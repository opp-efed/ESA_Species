After overlap runs are complete raw results are will be transformed from pixel counts by distance to percent overlap by
distance interval

**BEFORE STARTING A NEW ROUND OF UPDATES BE SURE TO UPDATE THE USER INPUT VARIABLES** There are two groups of user input
variables, one group that is updated for each run, and a second group that should be updated once when the use layers or
the species files are updated

overwrite_inter_data = overwrite boolean - set to false tables were already generated for some uses and new ones need
to be added.  If a use layer was updated delete or archive the tables for the dated version and set this to false.  If
this variable is set to TRUE than all tables will be recalculated.

Key variable - Acres tables need to be locked to get to percentage; Need buy in chemical team on look-up table

Key Tracking : Root folder for output file locations need to remain consistent for all runs.  File structure
is automated.   Look-up table should have buy in from chemical team

Step 1 - Generate list in a csv of all uses names using the standard file structure generated in the overlap runs
   - use to generate the look-up table to standardize columns headers; and to pull chemical specific information
   such as sub-set of layer, max drift, application method etc

   - Output table will include the list of all available use layer results and the standard structure for the table so
   it can be read into the other scripts.  **User must populated the additional columns that are blank in the output and
   confirm chemical information with chemical team**

   ** Note to run just the Step 1 use layer, or a different sub-set of layers generate a new table will just the layers
   of interest and update the variable**

Step 2-  Transforms table from zones to species, sum results by species and calculates percentage overlap
Step 3 - Breaks tables into the desired distance interval - default 30m
Step 4- Generates the summary tables for the BE - ie direct use overlap, overlap for ground and aerial
Step 5- Collapses table across regions - Step was Archived spring 2018
