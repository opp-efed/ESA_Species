Description: When incorporating usage to the overlap output summaries are supplemented using several additional data
sources: Original downloads, and master files used for analysis backed up to F drive; final spatial libraries on F and
OneDrive. All files we place in the regional projection identified by team (Fall 2016).  If a geographic transformation
was need "NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1" was selected (B_StandardizeProject_move_Rasters.py).  File projections can be found in
the Use layer tracking file.

Data sources used to supplement overlap date for usage:
    - Counties/State boundaries Tiger : https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html - downloaded Fall 2017
    path to file: r'D:\One_drive_old_computer_20180214\OneDrive - Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    \Documents_C_drive\Projects\ESA\_ExternalDrive\_CurrentSpeciesSpatialFiles\Boundaries.gdb\Counties_all_overlap'
    (Back up Species support info library F

    - NHDplus Seamless data set: http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/ - downloaded Fall 2017
        - Seamless data set is supplemented with island boundaries for AK, AS, CNMI and HI from Tiger Census that are
        not found in the original file.  This is done so these areas are not lost when running the intersect in
        Aa_Intersect_Cnty_HUC2.py
        - Also A/B splits are included for the HUC_2 by joining the current output from
        A_Bins\Step_A2_splitHUC2_A_B_Summarize.py to the HUC12s and updated the HUC2_AB column. This is down so the
        correct file from the PWC model can be identified in the MagTool

    - Elevation: https://www.landfire.gov/version_comparison.php download May 2018 see email from S. Lennartz on 4/12/18
        - Smoothed to 10 meters due to the number of unique values generate by the combine when using the original data
        set with single meter increments (ESA team meeting May 2018).  This decision point can be revisited in the
        future if need. Discussed smoothing with S. Lennartz May 2018.
        - Smoothed using the raster calculator command (Int(("[layer_name]"/10)+0.5))*10

    - Habitat:
        CONUS, AK, HI, PR :https://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/data/download/ - download May 2018
        Other NL48 - https://coast.noaa.gov/ccapftp/#/ -download May 2018

        - used original file; but reprojected as needed

A_Intersect_Cnty_HUC2.py - Intersects the unioned species/CH vector files with the political boundaries from TIGER and
the supplemented HUC12/HUC2 boundaries from the NHDPlus.  After completed this step Step 4, 5 and 6 from
4b_GenerateSpatialFiles_forOverlap_Species can be implements to convert these files to raster, project them by region
and export to GRIDs used for the combine (D_Combine) - Replaced original usage input file generation
A_Intersect_Cnty.py and  B_Select_L48.py to accommodate the output needed for the aquatic modeling (April - June 2018)
    - Run time  CH files = ~ 1 hour; Range files = ~ ~4 hours
    - (Back up Union Composites_ESA on library F, files used for analysis oneDrive)

B_StandardizeProject_move_Rasters.py : Standardize projection of raster files used in combine and moves them the the
spatial library for the appropriate region
    -(Back up Use_layer library F)


C_Combine.py: NOTE must increase the number of unique value for raster (used 2,000,000,000) under option then raster
run combine on the species files with cnty and huc information from A_Intersect_Cnty_HUC2.py with the
support raster information found in the raster spatial libraries; on/off field and residential and habitat/elevation.
These are the input files used to run the overlap so the usage overlap  tables can include the additional supporting
information identified above  - Overlap is run using  (Step1_Species_Use_ZonalHis.py)- Information is extracted by
joining output tables using the various data source IDs (ZoneID, InterID, HUCID and ROWID from combine)
    -- (Back up Union Composites_ESA on library F, files used for analysis oneDrive)
    -- Combine in the L48 takes a long time - had to reduce to just elevation and habitat
    #TODO look at do a second combine for on off field
        - Split out by species group, Birds took over 15.5 hours, mammals 16 hours, fishes 22 hours, flowers 10 hours
        - ran conifers- crust; ran amphib - bird, clams, insect - reptiles, snails, ferns, fishes, flower,
          'insect', -'reptil','snails ; took between 45 minutes and 15.5 hours most ~3.5
    --Split it out by regions - HI took second longest
