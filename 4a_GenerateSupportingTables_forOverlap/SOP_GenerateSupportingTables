#TODO update region in the region dissolve from L48 to CONUS - abbreviation in the acres table needs to be Acre_CONUS
When Spatial libraries are considered locked for a given overlap update Steps 4 a, b c - Notes withing the directories
will prompt what steps can be run simultaneously

Input parameters/Decisions/Agreements made by ESA team

ESA Team Spring 2016; updated Fall 2017
•	Acres calculated for the whole range used web Mercator (WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere.prj)
•	Acres for a specific region uses the projection specified for that region - see UseList documentation or projection dictionary in python script
•	Total acres on land is the sum of the individual region value; Total NL48 is the sum of the NL48 regions

ESA Team Spring 2016
•   Composite files are clipped to land using the TIGER census boundaries
•	Polygons converted to raster using "MAXIMUM_COMBINED_AREA" assignment
•	Snap raster used for polygon to raster conversion – same snap raster used for all analyses

•	Files used to supplement species location files: Agreements spring 2016
o	County/State boundaries – usage
o	HUC 2- Aquatic MagTool
	Seamless data set is supplemented with island boundaries for AK, AS, CNMI and HI from Tiger Census that are not found in the original file.
	A/B splits are included for the HUC_2 by joining the current output from A_Bins\Step_A2_splitHUC2_A_B_Summarize.py to the HUC12s and updated the HUC2_AB column
o	Elevation – WoE –
	Smoothed to 10 meter due to number of unique values generated with raw files
o	Habitat – WoE
	Projected in the projection for region as needed

Step 4a:

 Step A - Time estimate ~ 3 hours (old computer) 15 minutes (new computer)
 Time estimate per species ~ 1-15 minutes per species except flowering plant which takes 2.5 hours (old computer)
 Time estimate per species ~ 2 or less minutes per species except flowering plant which takes 8 min (new computer)

 Flowering plants can take a long time to generate- one the script reaches this species group it can be
 re-started to create the other species group files while flowering plants completes

 Step B- Check for missing species against the master list for range files only - checks for missing species happen
 several other places

 Step C - Start 4B

 Step D - Time estimate ~ CH 1.5 hours range 3.5 (new computer) old computer 10 hours
 Intersect Regions intersect regions, explodes and dissolves to generate multipart polygons specific to certain regions

 Step E -
    Projects geographic output from Step D into Web Mercator to get the acres for the full range- web mercator
    TODO clean up script - can be streamlined
    Use the 2 dissolve file from Step D - the one that has been exploded, regions assigned then dissolved - polygons in
    regions are separate from each other

Steps F - H  - Updates to Species Location Tabulated Files; Goal: Update the species look-up tables used if the GIS analysis.  This look-up include the zone look-ups,
species location by region and species by region. These look-up tables are later used as inputs to the GIS
analysis
 Step F - Acres tables
    Generates acres table- for each species you will have the acres from each region where it occurs; the region
    region specific value is in the projection for that region; the total acres value is from the web mercator file
    generated in Step E and is in a projected web mercator

 Step G- L48/NL48
    places species into L48/NL48 or both for sorting; will also note the number of NL48 regions where the species is
    found

Step H- Converts acres to another area unit

Step  4B - is delayed to Step C because 4a E takes so long:

 Step 1a - updates ATT tables of merged composite files  to master list

 Step 2 -  Time estimate ~ 15 hours
     Union files to be used in overlap runs - union so no one location on the ground is run more than once
     step b- add unique key ZoneID used as key in overlap
     ** NOTE NOTE** After union finishes compare list of species included in union to make master to make sure no
     species were missed - this should be done by two people****

     Time estimate per species 2-5 or less minutes per species except flowering plant CH ~ 30 minutes R 3.5 hours to
     generate and 3.5 to clean for a total of 7 hours for flowering plant
     Flowering plants can take a long time to generate- one the script reaches this species group it can be
     re-started to create the other species group files while flowering plants completes
     skipgroup = ['Flowering_Plants']

     Result - Union composite files; and generate the list of species included in each union
     TODO clean up of flowering plants takes the longest- finding a way to do this more quickly would speed up the
     process; this can be done in arcpy by hiding the fields in ArcMap then exporting the file- quicker than current
     logic in python


    2a- generates just the union list of species by species group to from union file to compare to master list;
    ***only need to run this if you slip the union into multiple runs to address flowering plant or other time consuming
    file***********
        **NOTE species that are miss are difficult to add back in - done by adding a 'fake' species group - generating
        comp file- and changing species group in master list; to update a species range same logic can be following by
        species must be removed from all zone in original union file FIRST - done manually

 Step 3 - Time estimate ~ 3 hours
    Clips union-ed composite file to land - Flowering plants takes the longest, once this files starts you can start a second
    instance of the script and it will skip to the other species files
        **Note note** be sure to populate the ZoneID field before clip! ZoneID=ObjectID of un-clipped files, Zones may
        drop when clipped to land and the objectID cannot be used as a look up for species or for a join

 Step 4 - Time estimate 12 hours
    convert union polygons to raster - cannot have multiple instances of script running due to schema locks
    snap raster for conversion must be a NAD 83 geographic project with 30 meter cells; default cell is very large;
    typical use the cult mask from current cdl
    Run time CH  ~ 1 hour Range ~3 hour

 Step 5- Time estimate ~ 6 hours for CONUS for CH and 10 for Range. If all of other regions are run at the same time they
 will finish first. NOTE you must skip AK and AS for CH in the skip region for CH.  Also use the skip region to run
 CONUS on its own.
    Projects rasters into region projections - limited the processing extent to just the region based on the snap raster


 Step 6- Time estimate 3.5 hours CH 9.5 Range
    coverts geodatabase raster to GRIDs
    Done to avoid schema locks from gdb when working with rasters found in the same region
    be aware files name length is limit is short - be sure to check for extra _ or spaces in file name - there should
    not be an _ at the end of the file name
    **Note - these names are used as IDs for naming output tables and joining back the
    union file to covert from result by zone to result by species**
