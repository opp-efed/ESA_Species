# Description: Intersects the vector unioned species composite files to other vector information that is used to
# summarize data when applying usage. This is currently the political boundaries from the census (counties) and the huc2
# from the NHDPlus supplemented with the a/b splits for the aquatic modeling.
#
# After completed this step Step 4, 5 and 6 from 4b_GenerateSpatialFiles_forOverlap_Species can be implements to convert
# these files to raster, project them by region and export to GRIDs used for the combine (D_Combine)

# Note this is hard code to intersect two vector files to the spcies files
# #TODO make this a dynamaic process so the number of vector files can be dynamic

# Input files to be intersect with species must cover the extent of the regions, IE include AS, GU etc
# HUC file includes EFEDs A/B split on the HUC2
